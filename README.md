## 🐶 Introduction
This project is designed to automatically classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model is trained to recognize features specific to each category. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## 🌟 Features
- **Binary Image Classification**: Distinguishes between dog and cat images.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models for improved accuracy.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for predictions.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves competitive performance on the dataset.

## ⚙️ Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dogs-and-cats-classification.git
   cd dogs-and-cats-classification
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
Once installed, you can start using the model for predictions:

1. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_dir path/to/dataset
   ```

2. **Make predictions:**
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model:**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --test_dir path/to/test_data
   ```

## 📚 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). It contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats, divided into training and validation sets.

- **Training Set**: 20,000 images
- **Validation Set**: 5,000 images

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following architecture:

- **Input Layer**: Image size 128x128 pixels
- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple layers with ReLU activation
- **Pooling Layers**: Max pooling for down-sampling
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Dense layers leading to a binary output

## 📈 Results
The model achieves a validation accuracy of approximately 95% after fine-tuning. Below is a sample confusion matrix from the validation set:

| Actual \ Predicted | Dog | Cat |
|--------------------|-----|-----|
| **Dog**            | 123 | 2   |
| **Cat**            | 4   | 121 |
